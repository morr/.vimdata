 * call-seq:
 *      socket.listen( int ) =&gt; 0
 * 
 * Listens for connections, using the specified +int+ as the backlog. A call
 * to _listen_ only applies if the +socket+ is of type SOCK_STREAM or 
 * SOCK_SEQPACKET.
 * 
 * === Parameter
 * * +backlog+ - the maximum length of the queue for pending connections.
 * 
 * === Example 1
 *      require 'socket'
 *      include Socket::Constants
 *      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
 *      sockaddr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in( 2200, 'localhost' )
 *      socket.bind( sockaddr )
 *      socket.listen( 5 )
 * 
 * === Example 2 (listening on an arbitary port, unix-based systems only):
 *      require 'socket'
 *      include Socket::Constants
 *      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
 *      socket.listen( 1 )
 * 
 * === Unix-based Exceptions
 * On unix based systems the above will work because a new +sockaddr+ struct
 * is created on the address ADDR_ANY, for an arbitrary port number as handed
 * off by the kernel. It will not work on Windows, because Windows requires that
 * the +socket+ is bound by calling _bind_ before it can _listen_.
 * 
 * If the _backlog_ amount exceeds the implementation-dependent maximum
 * queue length, the implementation's maximum queue length will be used.
 * 
 * On unix-based based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if the
 * call to _listen_ fails:
 * * Errno::EBADF - the _socket_ argument is not a valid file descriptor
 * * Errno::EDESTADDRREQ - the _socket_ is not bound to a local address, and 
 *   the protocol does not support listening on an unbound socket
 * * Errno::EINVAL - the _socket_ is already connected
 * * Errno::ENOTSOCK - the _socket_ argument does not refer to a socket
 * * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the _socket_ protocol does not support listen
 * * Errno::EACCES - the calling process does not have approriate privileges
 * * Errno::EINVAL - the _socket_ has been shut down
 * * Errno::ENOBUFS - insufficient resources are available in the system to 
 *   complete the call
 * 
 * === Windows Exceptions
 * On Windows systems the following system exceptions may be raised if 
 * the call to _listen_ fails:
 * * Errno::ENETDOWN - the network is down
 * * Errno::EADDRINUSE - the socket's local address is already in use. This 
 *   usually occurs during the execution of _bind_ but could be delayed
 *   if the call to _bind_ was to a partially wildcard address (involving
 *   ADDR_ANY) and if a specific address needs to be commmitted at the 
 *   time of the call to _listen_
 * * Errno::EINPROGRESS - a Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress or the
 *   service provider is still processing a callback function
 * * Errno::EINVAL - the +socket+ has not been bound with a call to _bind_.
 * * Errno::EISCONN - the +socket+ is already connected
 * * Errno::EMFILE - no more socket descriptors are available
 * * Errno::ENOBUFS - no buffer space is available
 * * Errno::ENOTSOC - +socket+ is not a socket
 * * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the referenced +socket+ is not a type that supports
 *   the _listen_ method
 * 
 * === See
 * * listen manual pages on unix-based systems
 * * listen function in Microsoft's Winsock functions reference
