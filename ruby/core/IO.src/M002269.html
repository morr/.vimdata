 *  call-seq:
 *     ios.readpartial(maxlen)              =&gt; string
 *     ios.readpartial(maxlen, outbuf)      =&gt; outbuf
 *
 *  Reads at most &lt;i&gt;maxlen&lt;/i&gt; bytes from the I/O stream.
 *  It blocks only if &lt;em&gt;ios&lt;/em&gt; has no data immediately available.
 *  It doesn't block if some data available.
 *  If the optional &lt;i&gt;outbuf&lt;/i&gt; argument is present,
 *  it must reference a String, which will receive the data.
 *  It raises &lt;code&gt;EOFError&lt;/code&gt; on end of file.
 *
 *  readpartial is designed for streams such as pipe, socket, tty, etc.
 *  It blocks only when no data immediately available.
 *  This means that it blocks only when following all conditions hold.
 *  * the buffer in the IO object is empty.
 *  * the content of the stream is empty.
 *  * the stream is not reached to EOF.
 *
 *  When readpartial blocks, it waits data or EOF on the stream.
 *  If some data is reached, readpartial returns with the data.
 *  If EOF is reached, readpartial raises EOFError.
 *
 *  When readpartial doesn't blocks, it returns or raises immediately.
 *  If the buffer is not empty, it returns the data in the buffer.
 *  Otherwise if the stream has some content,
 *  it returns the data in the stream. 
 *  Otherwise if the stream is reached to EOF, it raises EOFError.
 *
 *     r, w = IO.pipe           #               buffer          pipe content
 *     w &lt;&lt; &quot;abc&quot;               #               &quot;&quot;              &quot;abc&quot;.
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      #=&gt; &quot;abc&quot;       &quot;&quot;              &quot;&quot;
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      # blocks because buffer and pipe is empty.
 *
 *     r, w = IO.pipe           #               buffer          pipe content
 *     w &lt;&lt; &quot;abc&quot;               #               &quot;&quot;              &quot;abc&quot;
 *     w.close                  #               &quot;&quot;              &quot;abc&quot; EOF
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      #=&gt; &quot;abc&quot;       &quot;&quot;              EOF
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      # raises EOFError
 *
 *     r, w = IO.pipe           #               buffer          pipe content
 *     w &lt;&lt; &quot;abc\ndef\n&quot;        #               &quot;&quot;              &quot;abc\ndef\n&quot;
 *     r.gets                   #=&gt; &quot;abc\n&quot;     &quot;def\n&quot;         &quot;&quot;
 *     w &lt;&lt; &quot;ghi\n&quot;             #               &quot;def\n&quot;         &quot;ghi\n&quot;
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      #=&gt; &quot;def\n&quot;     &quot;&quot;              &quot;ghi\n&quot;
 *     r.readpartial(4096)      #=&gt; &quot;ghi\n&quot;     &quot;&quot;              &quot;&quot;
 *
 *  Note that readpartial behaves similar to sysread.
 *  The differences are:
 *  * If the buffer is not empty, read from the buffer instead of &quot;sysread for buffered IO (IOError)&quot;.
 *  * It doesn't cause Errno::EAGAIN and Errno::EINTR.  When readpartial meets EAGAIN and EINTR by read system call, readpartial retry the system call.
 *
 *  The later means that readpartial is nonblocking-flag insensitive.
 *  It blocks on the situation IO#sysread causes Errno::EAGAIN as if the fd is blocking mode.
