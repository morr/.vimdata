 * call-seq:
 *      socket.recvfrom(maxlen) =&gt; [mesg, sender_sockaddr]
 *      socket.recvfrom(maxlen, flags) =&gt; [mesg, sender_sockaddr]
 * 
 * Receives up to _maxlen_ bytes from +socket+. _flags_ is zero or more
 * of the +MSG_+ options. The first element of the results, _mesg_, is the data
 * received. The second element, _sender_sockaddr_, contains protocol-specific information
 * on the sender.
 * 
 * === Parameters
 * * +maxlen+ - the number of bytes to receive from the socket
 * * +flags+ - zero or more of the +MSG_+ options 
 * 
 * === Example
 *      # In one file, start this first
 *      require 'socket'
 *      include Socket::Constants
 *      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
 *      sockaddr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in( 2200, 'localhost' )
 *      socket.bind( sockaddr )
 *      socket.listen( 5 )
 *      client, client_sockaddr = socket.accept
 *      data = client.recvfrom( 20 )[0].chomp
 *      puts &quot;I only received 20 bytes '#{data}'&quot;
 *      sleep 1
 *      socket.close
 * 
 *      # In another file, start this second
 *      require 'socket'
 *      include Socket::Constants
 *      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
 *      sockaddr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in( 2200, 'localhost' )
 *      socket.connect( sockaddr )
 *      socket.puts &quot;Watch this get cut short!&quot;
 *      socket.close 
 * 
 * === Unix-based Exceptions
 * On unix-based based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if the
 * call to _recvfrom_ fails:
 * * Errno::EAGAIN - the +socket+ file descriptor is marked as O_NONBLOCK and no
 *   data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no out-of-band data
 *   is available and either the +socket+ file descriptor is marked as 
 *   O_NONBLOCK or the +socket+ does not support blocking to wait for 
 *   out-of-band-data
 * * Errno::EWOULDBLOCK - see Errno::EAGAIN
 * * Errno::EBADF - the +socket+ is not a valid file descriptor
 * * Errno::ECONNRESET - a connection was forcibly closed by a peer
 * * Errno::EFAULT - the socket's internal buffer, address or address length 
 *   cannot be accessed or written
 * * Errno::EINTR - a signal interupted _recvfrom_ before any data was available
 * * Errno::EINVAL - the MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available
 * * Errno::EIO - an i/o error occurred while reading from or writing to the 
 *   filesystem
 * * Errno::ENOBUFS - insufficient resources were available in the system to 
 *   perform the operation
 * * Errno::ENOMEM - insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request
 * * Errno::ENOSR - there were insufficient STREAMS resources available to 
 *   complete the operation
 * * Errno::ENOTCONN - a receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that
 *   is not connected
 * * Errno::ENOTSOCK - the +socket+ does not refer to a socket
 * * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the specified flags are not supported for this socket type
 * * Errno::ETIMEDOUT - the connection timed out during connection establishment
 *   or due to a transmission timeout on an active connection
 * 
 * === Windows Exceptions
 * On Windows systems the following system exceptions may be raised if 
 * the call to _recvfrom_ fails:
 * * Errno::ENETDOWN - the network is down
 * * Errno::EFAULT - the internal buffer and from parameters on +socket+ are not
 *   part of the user address space, or the internal fromlen parameter is
 *   too small to accomodate the peer address
 * * Errno::EINTR - the (blocking) call was cancelled by an internal call to
 *   the WinSock function WSACancelBlockingCall
 * * Errno::EINPROGRESS - a blocking Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress or 
 *   the service provider is still processing a callback function
 * * Errno::EINVAL - +socket+ has not been bound with a call to _bind_, or an
 *   unknown flag was specified, or MSG_OOB was specified for a socket with
 *   SO_OOBINLINE enabled, or (for byte stream-style sockets only) the internal
 *   len parameter on +socket+ was zero or negative
 * * Errno::EISCONN - +socket+ is already connected. The call to _recvfrom_ is
 *   not permitted with a connected socket on a socket that is connetion 
 *   oriented or connectionless.
 * * Errno::ENETRESET - the connection has been broken due to the keep-alive 
 *   activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress.
 * * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - MSG_OOB was specified, but +socket+ is not stream-style
 *   such as type SOCK_STREAM. OOB data is not supported in the communication
 *   domain associated with +socket+, or +socket+ is unidirectional and 
 *   supports only send operations
 * * Errno::ESHUTDOWN - +socket+ has been shutdown. It is not possible to 
 *   call _recvfrom_ on a socket after _shutdown_ has been invoked.
 * * Errno::EWOULDBLOCK - +socket+ is marked as nonblocking and a  call to 
 *   _recvfrom_ would block.
 * * Errno::EMSGSIZE - the message was too large to fit into the specified buffer
 *   and was truncated.
 * * Errno::ETIMEDOUT - the connection has been dropped, because of a network
 *   failure or because the system on the other end went down without
 *   notice
 * * Errno::ECONNRESET - the virtual circuit was reset by the remote side 
 *   executing a hard or abortive close. The application should close the
 *   socket; it is no longer usable. On a UDP-datagram socket this error
 *   indicates a previous send operation resulted in an ICMP Port Unreachable
 *   message.
