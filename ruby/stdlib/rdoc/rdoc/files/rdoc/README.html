      <h1>RDOC - Ruby Documentation System</h1>
<p>
This package contains Rdoc and SimpleMarkup. Rdoc is an application that
produces documentation for one or more Ruby source files. We work similarly
to JavaDoc, parsing the source, and extracting the definition for classes,
modules, and methods (along with includes and requires). We associate with
these optional documentation contained in the immediately preceding comment
block, and then render the result using a pluggable output formatter.
(Currently, HTML is the only supported format. Markup is a library that
converts plain text into various output formats. The Markup library is used
to interpret the comment blocks that Rdoc uses to document methods,
classes, and so on.
</p>
<p>
This library contains two packages, rdoc itself and a text markup library,
&#8216;markup&#8217;.
</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use Rdoc to create documentation for your Ruby source files,
read on.

</li>
<li>If you want to include extensions written in C, see
rdoc/parsers/parse_c.rb.

</li>
<li>For information on the various markups available in comment blocks, see
markup/simple_markup.rb.

</li>
<li>If you want to drive Rdoc programatically, see <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc::RDoc</a>.

</li>
<li>If you want to use the library to format text blocks into HTML, have a look
at <a href="../../classes/SM/SimpleMarkup.html">SM::SimpleMarkup</a>.

</li>
<li>If you want to try writing your own HTML output template, see <a
href="../../classes/RDoc/Page.html">RDoc::Page</a>.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Once installed, you can create documentation using the &#8216;rdoc&#8217;
command (the command is &#8216;rdoc.bat&#8217; under Windows)
</p>
<pre>
  % rdoc [options]  [names...]
</pre>
<p>
Type &quot;rdoc &#8212;help&quot; for an up-to-date option summary.
</p>
<p>
A typical use might be to generate documentation for a package of Ruby
source (such as rdoc itself).
</p>
<pre>
  % rdoc
</pre>
<p>
This command generates documentation for all the Ruby and C source files in
and below the current directory. These will be stored in a documentation
tree starting in the subdirectory &#8216;doc&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
You can make this slightly more useful for your readers by having the index
page contain the documentation for the primary file. In our case, we could
type
</p>
<pre>
  % rdoc --main rdoc/rdoc.rb
</pre>
<p>
You&#8216;ll find information on the various formatting tricks you can use
in comment blocks in the documentation this generates.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> uses file extensions to
determine how to process each file. File names ending <tt>.rb</tt> and
<tt>.rbw</tt> are assumed to be Ruby source. Files ending <tt>.c</tt> are
parsed as C files. All other files are assumed to contain just
SimpleMarkup-style markup (with or without leading &#8217;#&#8217; comment
markers). If directory names are passed to <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a>, they are scanned recursively for C
and Ruby source files only.
</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Ruby parser in rdoc/parse.rb is based heavily on the outstanding work
of Keiju ISHITSUKA of Nippon Rational Inc, who produced the Ruby parser for
irb and the rtags package.

</li>
<li>Code to diagram classes and modules was written by Sergey A Yanovitsky
(Jah) of Enticla.

</li>
<li>Charset patch from MoonWolf.

</li>
<li>Rich Kilmer wrote the kilmer.rb output template.

</li>
<li>Dan Brickley led the design of the RDF format.

</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> is invoked from the command line
using:
</p>
<pre>
   % rdoc &lt;options&gt; [name...]
</pre>
<p>
Files are parsed, and the information they contain collected, before any
output is produced. This allows cross references between all files to be
resolved. If a name is a directory, it is traversed. If no names are
specified, all Ruby files in the current directory (and subdirectories) are
processed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Options.html">Options</a> are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>&#8212;accessor</tt> <em><a href="http://,name...">name</a></em></dt><dd>specifies the name(s) of additional methods that should be treated as if
they were <tt>attr_</tt><em>xxx</em> methods. Specifying
&quot;&#8212;accessor db_opt&quot; means lines such as

<pre>
     db_opt :name, :age
</pre>
<p>
will get parsed and displayed in the documentation. Each name may have an
optional &quot;=flagtext&quot; appended, in which case the given flagtext
will appear where (for example) the &#8216;rw&#8217; appears for
attr_accessor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;all</tt></dt><dd>include protected and private methods in the output (by default only public
methods are included)

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;charset</tt> <em>charset</em></dt><dd>Set the character set for the generated HTML.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;diagram</tt></dt><dd>include diagrams showing modules and classes. This is currently an
experimental feature, and may not be supported by all output templates. You
need dot V1.8.6 or later to use the &#8212;diagram option correctly (<a
href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz">www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz</a>/).

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;exclude</tt> <em>pattern</em></dt><dd>exclude files and directories matching this pattern from processing

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;extension</tt> <em>new=old</em></dt><dd>treat files ending <em>.new</em> as if they ended <em>.old</em>. Saying
&#8217;&#8212;extension cgi=rb&#8217; causes <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> to treat .cgi files as Ruby source.

</dd>
<dt><tt>fileboxes</tt></dt><dd>Classes are put in boxes which represents files, where these classes
reside. Classes shared between more than one file are shown with list of
files that sharing them. Silently discarded if &#8212;diagram is not given
Experimental.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;fmt</tt> <em>fmt</em></dt><dd>generate output in a particular format.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;help</tt></dt><dd>generate a usage summary.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;help-output</tt></dt><dd>explain the various output options.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;image-format</tt> <em>gif/png/jpg/jpeg</em></dt><dd>sets output image format for diagrams. Can be png, gif, jpeg, jpg. If this
option is omitted, png is used. Requires &#8212;diagram.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;include</tt> <em>dir,&#8230;</em></dt><dd>specify one or more directories to be searched when satisfying
:<tt>include</tt>: directives. Multiple <tt>&#8212;include</tt> options may
be given. The directory containing the file currently being processed is
always searched.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;inline-source</tt></dt><dd>By default, the source code of methods is shown in a popup. With this
option, it&#8216;s displayed inline.

</dd>
<dt><tt>line-numbers</tt></dt><dd>include line numbers in the source code

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;main</tt> <em>name</em></dt><dd>the class of module <em>name</em> will appear on the index page. If you
want to set a particular file as a main page (a README, for example) simply
specifiy its name as the first on the command line.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;merge</tt></dt><dd>when generating <em>ri</em> output, if classes being processed already
exist in the destination directory, merge in the current details rather
than overwrite them.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;one-file</tt></dt><dd>place all the output into a single file

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;op</tt> <em>dir</em></dt><dd>set the output directory to <em>dir</em> (the default is the directory
&quot;doc&quot;)

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;op-name</tt> <em>name</em></dt><dd>set the name of the output. Has no effect for HTML. &quot;doc&quot;)

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;opname</tt> <em>name</em></dt><dd>set the output name (has no effect for HTML).

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;promiscuous</tt></dt><dd>If a module or class is defined in more than one source file, and you click
on a particular file&#8216;s name in the top navigation pane, <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> will normally only show you the
inner classes and modules of that class that are defined in the particular
file. Using this option makes it show all classes and modules defined in
the class, regardless of the file they were defined in.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;quiet</tt></dt><dd>do not display progress messages

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;ri</tt>, <tt>&#8212;ri-site</tt>, <em>and</em> <tt>&#8212;ri-system</tt></dt><dd>generate output than can be read by the <em>ri</em> command-line tool. By
default &#8212;ri places its output in ~/.rdoc, &#8212;ri-site in
$datadir/ri/&lt;ver&gt;/site, and &#8212;ri-system in
$datadir/ri/&lt;ver&gt;/system. All can be overridden with a subsequent
&#8212;op option. All default directories are in ri&#8216;s default search
path.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;show-hash</tt></dt><dd>A name of the form name in a comment is a possible hyperlink to an instance
method name. When displayed, the &#8217;#&#8217; is removed unless this
option is specified

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;style</tt> <em>stylesheet url</em></dt><dd>specifies the URL of an external stylesheet to use (rather than generating
one of our own)

</dd>
<dt><tt>tab-width</tt> <em>n</em></dt><dd>set the width of tab characters (default 8)

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;template</tt> <em>name</em></dt><dd>specify an alternate template to use when generating output (the default is
&#8216;standard&#8217;). This template should be in a directory accessible
via $: as rdoc/generators/xxxx_template, where &#8216;xxxx&#8217; depends
on the output formatter.

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;version</tt></dt><dd>display <a href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a>&#8216;s version

</dd>
<dt><tt>&#8212;webcvs</tt> <em>url</em></dt><dd>Specify a URL for linking to a web frontend to CVS. If the URL contains a
&#8217;\%s&#8217;, the name of the current file will be substituted; if the
URL doesn&#8216;t contain a &#8217;\%s&#8217;, the filename will be
appended to it.

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>
A typical small Ruby program commented using <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> might be as follows. You can see
the formatted result in EXAMPLE.rb and Anagram.
</p>
<h1>Markup</h1>
<p>
Comment blocks can be written fairly naturally, either using
&#8217;#&#8217; on successive lines of the comment, or by including the
comment in an =begin/=end block. If you use the latter form, the =begin
line must be flagged with an <a href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a>
tag:
</p>
<pre>
  =begin rdoc
  Documentation to
  be processed by RDoc.
  =end
</pre>
<p>
Paragraphs are lines that share the left margin. Text indented past this
margin are formatted verbatim.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Lists are typed as indented paragraphs with:

<ul>
<li>a &#8217;*&#8217; or &#8217;-&#8217; (for bullet lists)

</li>
<li>a digit followed by a period for numbered lists

</li>
<li>an upper or lower case letter followed by a period for alpha lists.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the input that produced the above paragraph looked like
</p>
<pre>
    1. Lists are typed as indented
       paragraphs with:
       * a '*' or '-' (for bullet lists)
       * a digit followed by a period for
         numbered lists
       * an upper or lower case letter followed
         by a period for alpha lists.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Labeled lists (sometimes called description lists) are typed using square
brackets for the label.

<pre>
   [cat]   small domestic animal
   [+cat+] command to copy standard input
</pre>
</li>
<li>Labeled lists may also be produced by putting a double colon after the
label. This sets the result in tabular form, so the descriptions all line
up. This was used to create the &#8216;author&#8217; block at the bottom of
this description.

<pre>
   cat::   small domestic animal
   +cat+:: command to copy standard input
</pre>
<p>
For both kinds of labeled lists, if the body text starts on the same line
as the label, then the start of that text determines the block indent for
the rest of the body. The text may also start on the line following the
label, indented from the start of the label. This is often preferable if
the label is long. Both the following are valid labeled list entries:
</p>
<pre>
   &lt;tt&gt;--output&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;name [, name]&lt;/i&gt;::
       specify the name of one or more output files. If multiple
       files are present, the first is used as the index.

   &lt;tt&gt;--quiet:&lt;/tt&gt;:: do not output the names, sizes, byte counts,
                       index areas, or bit ratios of units as
                       they are processed.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Headings are entered using equals signs

<pre>
   = Level One Heading
   == Level Two Heading
</pre>
<p>
and so on
</p>
</li>
<li>Rules (horizontal lines) are entered using three or more hyphens.

</li>
<li>Non-verbatim text can be marked up:

<table>
<tr><td valign="top"><em>italic</em>:</td><td>_word_ or &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>bold</b>:</td><td>*word* or &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>typewriter</tt>:</td><td>+word+ or &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The first form only works around &#8216;words&#8217;, where a word is a
sequence of upper and lower case letters and underscores. Putting a
backslash before inline markup stops it being interpreted, which is how I
created the table above:
</p>
<pre>
  _italic_::     \_word_ or \&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;
  *bold*::       \*word* or \&lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;
  +typewriter+:: \+word+ or \&lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Names of classes, source files, and any method names containing an
underscore or preceded by a hash character are automatically hyperlinked
from comment text to their description.

</li>
<li>Hyperlinks to the web starting http:, mailto:, ftp:, or www. are
recognized. An HTTP url that references an external image file is converted
into an inline &lt;IMG..&gt;. Hyperlinks starting &#8216;link:&#8217; are
assumed to refer to local files whose path is relative to the &#8212;op
directory.

<p>
Hyperlinks can also be of the form <tt>label</tt>[url], in which case the
label is used in the displayed text, and <tt>url</tt> is used as the
target. If <tt>label</tt> contains multiple words, put it in braces:
<em>{multi word label}[</em>url<em>]</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>Method parameter lists are extracted and displayed with the method
description. If a method calls <tt>yield</tt>, then the parameters passed
to yield will also be displayed:

<pre>
   def fred
     ...
     yield line, address
</pre>
<p>
This will get documented as
</p>
<pre>
   fred() { |line, address| ... }
</pre>
<p>
You can override this using a comment containing &#8217;:yields:
&#8230;&#8217; immediately after the method definition
</p>
<pre>
   def fred      # :yields: index, position
     ...
     yield line, address
</pre>
<p>
which will get documented as
</p>
<pre>
    fred() { |index, position| ... }
</pre>
</li>
<li>&#8217;:yields:&#8217; is an example of a documentation modifier. These
appear immediately after the start of the document element they are
modifying. Other modifiers include

<dl>
<dt><tt>:nodoc:</tt><em>[all]</em></dt><dd>don&#8216;t include this element in the documentation. For classes and
modules, the methods, aliases, constants, and attributes directly within
the affected class or module will also be omitted. By default, though,
modules and classes within that class of module <em>will</em> be
documented. This is turned off by adding the <tt>all</tt> modifier.

<pre>
     module SM  #:nodoc:
       class Input
       end
     end
     module Markup #:nodoc: all
       class Output
       end
     end
</pre>
<p>
In the above code, only class <tt>SM::Input</tt> will be documented.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:doc:</tt></dt><dd>force a method or attribute to be documented even if it wouldn&#8216;t
otherwise be. Useful if, for example, you want to include documentation of
a particular private method.

</dd>
<dt><tt>:notnew:</tt></dt><dd>only applicable to the <tt>initialize</tt> instance method. Normally <a
href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> assumes that the documentation and
parameters for initialize are actually for the ::new method, and so fakes
out a ::new for the class. THe :notnew: modifier stops this. Remember that
initialize is protected, so you won&#8216;t see the documentation unless
you use the -a command line option.

</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><a href="../../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> stops processing comments if it
finds a comment line containing &#8216;<tt>#&#8212;</tt>&#8217;. This can
be used to separate external from internal comments, or to stop a comment
being associated with a method, class, or module. Commenting can be turned
back on with a line that starts &#8216;<tt>#++</tt>&#8217;.

<pre>
    # Extract the age and calculate the
    # date-of-birth.
    #--
    # FIXME: fails if the birthday falls on
    # February 29th
    #++
    # The DOB is returned as a Time object.

    def get_dob(person)
       ...
</pre>
</li>
<li>Comment blocks can contain other directives:

<dl>
<dt><tt>:section: title</tt></dt><dd>Starts a new section in the output. The title following <tt>:section:</tt>
is used as the section heading, and the remainder of the comment containing
the section is used as introductory text. Subsequent methods, aliases,
attributes, and classes will be documented in this section. A :section:
comment block may have one or more lines before the :section: directive.
These will be removed, and any identical lines at the end of the block are
also removed. This allows you to add visual cues such as

<pre>
   # ----------------------------------------
   # This is the section that I wrote.
   # See it glisten in the noon-day sun.
   # ----------------------------------------
</pre>
</dd>
<dt><tt>call-seq:</tt></dt><dd>lines up to the next blank line in the comment are treated as the
method&#8216;s calling sequence, overriding the default parsing of method
parameters and yield arguments.

</dd>
<dt><tt>:include:</tt><em>filename</em></dt><dd>include the contents of the named file at this point. The file will be
searched for in the directories listed by the <tt>&#8212;include</tt>
option, or in the current directory by default. The contents of the file
will be shifted to have the same indentation as the &#8217;:&#8217; at the
start of the :include: directive.

</dd>
<dt><tt>:title:</tt><em>text</em></dt><dd>Sets the title for the document. Equivalent to the &#8212;title command
line parameter. (The command line parameter overrides any :title: directive
in the source).

</dd>
<dt><tt>:enddoc:</tt></dt><dd>Document nothing further at the current level.

</dd>
<dt><tt>:main:</tt><em>name</em></dt><dd>Equivalent to the &#8212;main command line parameter.

</dd>
<dt><tt>:stopdoc: / :startdoc:</tt></dt><dd>Stop and start adding new documentation elements to the current container.
For example, if a class has a number of constants that you don&#8216;t want
to document, put a <tt>:stopdoc:</tt> before the first, and a
<tt>:startdoc:</tt> after the last. If you don&#8216;t specifiy a
<tt>:startdoc:</tt> by the end of the container, disables documentation for
the entire class or module.
